            <h2>1) What is cyber safety and why is it important for students?</h2>
            <p>Cyber safety refers to the practice of protecting yourself, your information, and your devices from online threats like hackers, cyberbullying, viruses, and scams. It’s important for students because they often use the internet for studies, entertainment, and socializing. By being aware of cyber safety, students can avoid falling victim to online threats, protect their personal data, and use the internet responsibly and safely. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h2>2) What kind of information do we need to protect online?</h2>
            <p>We must protect our personal details like names, passwords, photos, school information, phone numbers, and financial data. Even small details can be misused if they fall into the wrong hands.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h2>3) Why should we avoid sharing personal information on social media?</h2>
            <p>Sharing personal information on social media (like your full name, address, phone number, school name, etc.) can make you vulnerable to cyber threats such as identity theft, cyberbullying, or even stalking. Cybercriminals can misuse this information to steal your identity or harm you in various ways. It's always safer to keep personal details private and share only what's necessary and safe.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h2>4) How do these online threats actually affect us in real life?</h2>
            <p>Cyber threats can lead to hacked accounts, money loss, leaked photos or messages, damaged reputation, or emotional stress. What happens online doesn’t stay online — it can impact school, friendships, and daily life.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h2>5) What simple habits can help us stay safe on the internet every day?</h2>
            <p>Using strong passwords, avoiding suspicious links, keeping devices updated, turning on two-factor authentication, and thinking before sharing personal information are some easy habits that make a big difference.
</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-item">
            <h2>6) How can we report concerns or get help if something feels unsafe online?</h2>
            <p>If you face cyberbullying, scams, or suspicious activity, you can talk to a trusted adult, report it to school authorities, or use national helplines and cybercrime portals. Asking for help is a responsible step — not a weakness.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Clickbait:</strong> Clickbait refers to content designed to attract attention and encourage clicks, often through sensationalized or misleading headlines that don't accurately reflect the content. It's primarily used to drive traffic rather than provide valuable information.</li>
            <li><strong>Hashing</strong>:</strong> Hashing is a process of converting data into a fixed-size string of characters, typically a hash code, using a mathematical algorithm. It is commonly used in cybersecurity for data integrity, encryption, and fast data retrieval.</li>
            <li><strong>Firewall:</strong> A firewall is a security system that monitors and controls network traffic, protecting against unauthorized access. It acts as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks, ensuring safe communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encryption is the process of converting data into a secure format using an algorithm, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. Only those with the correct decryption key can access the original data.</li>
            <li><strong>VPN:</strong> A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that encrypts your internet connection, providing a secure and private network over the public internet, often used to protect privacy and access restricted content.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> Cookies are small pieces of data stored by a website on a user's device to remember information such as login details, preferences, or browsing history. They help improve user experience and personalize content.</li>
            <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication:</strong> Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a security process where a user provides two different authentication factors—something they know (like a password) and something they have (like a smartphone or security token)—to verify their identity and enhance security.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Breach:</strong> CUSTOMIZE.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital Footprint:</strong> A digital footprint refers to the trail of data you leave behind as you use the internet, including your online activities, social media posts, and interactions. It can be either active (e.g., posts, messages) or passive (e.g., browsing history, location data).
            </li>
            <li><strong>Bot/Botnet:</strong> CUSTOMIZE.</li>
